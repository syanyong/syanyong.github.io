<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- <p>Hello! I'm Sy A. Yanyong, a researcher at the School of Engineering. My work focuses on innovative solutions in engineering and technology. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or inquiries.</p> -->

Sarucha Yanyong serves as a Lecturer in the Department of Robotics and AI, School of Engineering, King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), a position he has held since June 2023. His research focuses on industrial robotics, mobile robotics, and intelligent control. He earned a D.Eng. in Electrical Engineering in 2023, supported by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) through the Research and Researchers for Industries (RRI) grant, and was a Visiting Research Student at the Multimedia Computing Systems Laboratory (MCSLab), Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), in Seoul, South Korea. This followed an M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering (2014) and a B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering (2012) from KMITL.

Prior to his academic career, he gained nearly five years of experience in railway signaling (software development) as an Application Engineer at Bombardier Transportation Signal (Thailand) Limited, now part of ALSTOM. In addition to his role as a researcher, he works as a software engineering consultant with expertise in deploying IT/OT solutions for automation and intelligent manufacturing.
