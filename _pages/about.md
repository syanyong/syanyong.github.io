## Background

Holding a D.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, I currently serve as a full-time Assistant Professor at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) since October 2024, having joined as a full-time lecturer in June 2023. My professional identity is defined by three converging roles: researcher, lecturer, and developer. My academic research centers on Intelligent Control and AI/ML adoption for manufacturing, while my industrial specialization lies in Software Development and Engineering Consultancy. I possess specific expertise in complex system integration, the critical intersection where networking, embedded systems, software, sensors, actuators, and control systems meet.

In my teaching capacity, I lead courses in Artificial Intelligence for graduate students, Microprocessors & Interface, Advanced Computer Programming (covering full-stack development, databases, and Containerization), and Mobile Robotics (ROS).

My doctoral studies were concentrated on energy optimization and path planning of **mobile robotics**. Over the years, I have implemented mobile robotics for different industries and expanded my interests into the realms of computer vision and machine learning. These research interests have been transformed into real-world applications, facilitated by my proficiency in an array of software tools and frameworks such as Pytorch, **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, MATLAB, Node JS, and React JS.

Based on my work experience, I invited to work as a **special lecturer at KMITL** since August 2019, accumulating a total of 4 years of teaching experience. During my tenure, I taught courses such as Computer Programming, Microprocessor and Interface, Mobile Robot (Robot Operating System), Industrial Project Application, Computer Vision, and Web application & Database. My responsibilities included providing IT consultancy and being a advisor for a senior project student for the Department of Robotics and AI.

I have several years of experience working as an Application Engineer at **Bombardier Transportation Signal (Thailand) Ltd.**, based in Bangkok, I played a key role in various projects within the company. My responsibilities included developing a site-specific application and automatic software testing framework for Interlocking Software. I also served as the Work Package Leader for the Interlocking Application Development under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cityflo_650_CBTC" target="_blank">CITYFLO650</a> solution moving block for the MRT Purple Line Project in Thailand. In this capacity, I managed the project's budget, supervised team members, and oversaw the verification and validation of safety documents related to software.

In addition to my leadership role, I actively participated in Interlocking Application Development and served as a reviewer. My tasks involved designing applications based on signaling plans and local operation procedures, configuring networks, and conducting safety assessments to ensure compliance with the EN50128 standard for train control systems of several major projects. My skills extend to Unix OS, Red Hat, Ubuntu, CentOS, shell scripting, Python, Jenkins, and GitLab. These projects included the BTS Green Line Extension (CITYFLO450) in Thailand, the Durban Re-signalling (CITYFLO200) in South Africa, and the <a href="https://bombardier.com/en/media/news/bombardier-wins-contract-provide-melbournes-first-high-capacity-signalling-system" target="_blank">Rail Systems Alliance (RSA)</a> CITYFLO650 solution in Melbourne, Australia. 

After leaving the railway industry, I decided to take on a new challenge by working on my own projects in the software industry, providing services to large consumer goods production companies such as <a href="https://www.unilever.com/" target="_blank">**Unilever**</a>, <a href="https://www.neo-factory.biz/" target="_blank">**NEO Factory**</a> and etc. I joined a software project team in Foster Engineering Co., Ltd., a company specializing in process control, PLC, and SCADA systems. My role in the company was not permanent, and I worked remotely for some projects because my focus was on software products only. As a **full-stack developer**, I was responsible for creating web-based inventory management with the prediction systems. And also small software for data transformation between applications. Most of the applications I developed were required to interface with SCADA and PLC systems and occasionally receive orders from SAP. Through this job, I gained valuable experience in various technologies, including Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, React, NodeJS, Python, Docker, and VMware ESXi.
